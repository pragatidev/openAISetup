# ChatGPT Development Environment Setup

This repository includes a Python script that automates the setup of a development environment for using ChatGPT with Python.

## Installation

To use this script, you will need to have Python and the OpenAI package installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website, and install the OpenAI package by running the following command:

pip install openai


Once you have these requirements installed, you can download the `setup_env.py` file from this repository and save it to a directory on your computer.

## Usage

To use the script, navigate to the directory where you saved `setup_env.py` and run the following command:

python setup_env.py --api_key <your_api_key_here>


Replace `<your_api_key_here>` with your actual OpenAI API key. This will execute the script and set up your development environment for using ChatGPT with Python.

By default, the script will create a new virtual environment named `chatgpt_env` and install the OpenAI package. You can customize the script to include additional packages or change the virtual environment name as needed.
